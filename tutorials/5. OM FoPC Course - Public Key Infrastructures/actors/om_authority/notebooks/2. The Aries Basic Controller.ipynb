    "# The Aries Basic Controller\n",
    "\n",
    "The aries basic controller is a simple python library that wraps a swagger-api exposed by the [ACA-Py Agent implementation](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python). It is designed to enable easy, programatic interface between business logic of an application (this is what you will write) and the capabilities of the Hyperledger SSI stack currently implemented by this agent codebase as a series of protocols. These are all defined in [aries-rfcs](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs)."

    "As we discussed in the [mental model for ssi application development](https://hackmd.io/YuQugi8dS0eAVuT1T1vaug) section of this course, aries agents are need to be controller. They understand a series of protocols and their associated messages which they can send and receive to other agents, but they do not know when to send them or what to do if they receive them.\n",
    "\n",
    "ACA-Py agents expose a swagger-api, defining a set of api endpoints you can use to communicate with an agent controlling it to create and send messages to other agents and they interact in defined aries protocols. You should be able to see the swagger documentation at this endpoint - http://localhost:8021/api/doc. Note if you are running this on a virtual machine such as an AWS EC2 instance you will need replace localhost with the IP address for that machine.\n",

If you want to dive deeper into aries I highly recommend taking the time to go through this lab [OpenApi lab](https://github.com/cloudcompass/ToIPLabs/blob/master/docs/LFS173x/OpenAPIController.md) from the an [EdX course](https://www.edx.org/course/becoming-a-hyperledger-aries-developer).\n",
