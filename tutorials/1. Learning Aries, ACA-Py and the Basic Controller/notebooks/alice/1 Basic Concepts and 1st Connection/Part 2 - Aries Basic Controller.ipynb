    "The aries basic controller is a simple python library that wraps a swagger api exposed by the BCGov [ACA-Py Agent implementation](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python). It is designed to enable easy, programatic interface between business logic of an application (this is what you will write) and the capabilities of the Hyperledger SSI stack currently implemented by this agent codebase, such as the issue-credential protocol. These are all defined in [aries-rfcs](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs)."

    "If you are short on time and prefer to get stuck into the code in these notebooks we highly recommend you at least run through the [OpenApi lab](https://github.com/cloudcompass/ToIPLabs/blob/master/docs/LFS173x/OpenAPIController.md) from the course.\n"

    "## Mental Model\n",
    "\n",
    "Where developing with SSI can be confusing (it was to me at least), is in understanding the mental model. The above courses are great for clarifying this in detail, I will just give a brief overview here.\n",
    "\n",
    "The components of an SSI application that uses ACA-Py are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The business/application logic - This is up to you and your imagination. What credentials does your application issue, what proofs do they expect to verify and what happens once a proof has been successfully verified? It can be as simple of complicated as you want.\n",
    "* A controller - The aries-basic-contoller is an example of this, but it could be written in any language. It is the mechansism for the business logic to invoke aries protocols within an agent. E.g. write this credential schema to the ledger for me, or issue this connection this credential with these attributes.\n",
    "* An SSI agent - The implementations of a set of specified aries-rfcs, not all agents have the same set implemented. The agent code interfaces with a ledger, manages a wallet and interacts with other agents.\n",
    "\n",
    "These set of components make up a single domain, however SSI was developed to simplfy and secure the interaction across domains between SSI applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "The SSI agent makes connections with other SSI agents and they then go on to exchange messages as part of predefined aries protocols that both understand. SSI agents are event driven. It is the business logic of the applications that determine when to make connections, which protocols to enage in and what responses to communicate.\n",
    "\n",
    "The general flow of interactions between two SSI applications defined by Alice and Bob is:\n",
    "* Alice(business logic -> controller -> agent) -> Bob(agent -> controller -> business logic)\n",
    "\n",
    "We will see this pattern regularly throughout this tutorial. Keep in mind, anything in these notebook is the business logic of the application."

    "## Docker Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "Before going any further take a look at the docker-compose.yml file in the root of the [aries-basic-controller tutorial directory](https://github.com/OpenMined/PyDentity/tree/master/tutorials/aries-basic-controller) and try to understand what is going on. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Dockerfiles\n",
    "\n",
    "The PyDentity repo uses common dockerfiles across all tutorials and experiments wherever possible. These can be found within the dockerfiles folder, with subfolders for agents and controller dockerfiles. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### SSI Applications (Bob and Alice)\n",
    "\n",
    "The docker-compose.yml defines two separate SSI applications: \n",
    "* Bob (bob-agent, bob-notebook) \n",
    "* Alice (alice-agent, alice-notebook)\n",
    "\n",
    "Usually when developing we will simulate at least two separate applications because most interesting aspects of SSI occur during interaction between agents. **Note: For a production deployment you would only develop one application and would expect other production deployments to interact with your agent.** An example of a productionish ssi application template can be found [here](https://github.com/wip-abramson/aries-acapy-fullstack-starter).\n",
    "\n",
    "The services from Alice and Bob are virtually identical, accept alices agent has an authenticated admin endpoint. More on this later. For simplicity we will just review Alice.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### alice-agent\n",
    "\n",
    "All agents us one of the dockerfiles in the dockerfiles/agents folder. To configure and start an agent, a set of arguments must be specified.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a [lab](https://github.com/cloudcompass/ToIPLabs/blob/master/docs/LFS173x/ACA-PyStartup.md) about the aca-py configuration parameters that is part of the EdX course. More details can be found by taking the actual course. \n",
    "\n",
    "All enviroment variables such as ALICE_HTTP_PORT are configured in the manage bash script. See lines 119 - 139. As we will see later these variables are used to configure an instance of the AriesAgentController.\n",
    "\n",
    "We use a common pattern to configure agents throughout this repo. The manage script within a tutorial or project defines the unique arguments for each agent. Within the docker-compose file these arguments are then mapped to generic argument names e.g. HTTP_PORT:${ALICE_HTTP_PORT}. The arguments are then used within a yml file which is passed into the agent on startup. yml files can be found in the configuration folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following command is uesed to populate the yml file and start the aca-py agent using this configuration file.\n",
    "\n",
    "```Docker\n",
    " command: [\n",
    "        \"-c\",\n",
    "          \"python3 scripts/parse_yml_env_variables.py -c ./configuration/aries-args-basic.yaml; \\\n",

    "          aca-py start --arg-file /tmp/agent_conf.yml\"\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### alice-notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "This service is created from the defined **Dockerfile**. It installs the aries-basic-controller package from the files within this directory. See lines 11 - 17. In the future this will be a pip installable package. Then it initialises a juypter notebook service that is looking for notebooks in the workspace directory of the container. This directory is populated by mounting a volume in the docker-compose.yml. For example alice-notebook mounts the notebooks/alice notebooks (this is one of them).\n",
    "\n",
    "Again it is worth pointing out the all code within these notebooks is the business logic of the SSI application.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a helper service that establishes a connection between Alice and Bob by running the helpers/create_connection/create_connection.py script once the agents have been initialised.\n",

    "\n",

    "An instance of AriesAgentController acts as the middle man between the business logic of an application and an ACA-Py agent instance. The business logic can communicate with the ACA-Py instance by sending specific requests to the ADMIN_URL, these requests are implemented in the controllers folder of the aries-basic-controller library.\n",
    "\n",

When the agent recieves a message from another agent over a connection, the business logic needs to be able to interpret that message and if needs be respond by communicating through the controller to the agent to take some action.\n",
    "\n",
