    "# Credential Schema and Definitions\n",
    "\n",
    "A credential schema has a name and version and defines a set of attribute names that once written to the ledger can be used to issue credentials following that schema. First though, all agents wishing to issue credentials following a particular schema must write a credential definition (also called claim definition) to the ledger. The credential definition is the public key for a specific agent for a specific credential schema, currently Hyperledger stack uses [CL Signatures](https://groups.csail.mit.edu/cis/pubs/lysyanskaya/cl02b.pdf). By using this type of signature scheme we are able to sign each attribute in the credential individually, making selective disclosure and efficient zero knowledge proof generation from attributes possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example written on the Sovrin MainNet:\n",
    "* [Credential Schema](https://indyscan.io/tx/SOVRIN_MAINNET/domain/54679)\n",
    "* [Credential Definition](https://indyscan.io/tx/SOVRIN_MAINNET/domain/54680)\n",
    "\n",
    "**It is important to keep in mind that only Public DIDs with write access to the ledger are able to write transactions such as schema or definitions to the ledger. The Sovrin MainNet for example is a public permissioned network.**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we will see how to use the AriesAgentController to write credential schema and definitions to the ledger and learn some important restrictions to be aware of."
