All connections through this entrypoint are challenged with an authentication policy that you will define, only once this policy has been met through a verifiable presentation will the connection become trusted.\n",

    "## 4. Create Data Scientist Invite\n",
    "\n",
    "As currently implemented the data scientist invitation is a one time invite. This could be changed to be a multi-use invitation through an argument that can be passed into the create_invitation() function.\n",
    "\n",
    "It depends on how the application would be using this invitation. Is it displayed statically on the data owner's website? Or does the website expose and button for the data scientist to request an invitation be created?\n",
    "\n",
    "The user experience and flow of these applications matters, but it is probably the least explored aspect of this technology. If your interested in looking into this with us we would love to have you. Here is an [issue](https://github.com/OpenMined/PyDentity/issues/36) I produced around this, comment if your interested."
