    "There are a number of apps available on the app store designed as *digital wallet's* to store verifiable credentials. The one's that work with the Hyperledger verifiable information platform all use code that implement's a set aries-rfcs, these specification's help ensure different implementations can interact.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can pick the application you would prefer to install from any of the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* [Connect.Me](https://www.connect.me/)\n",
    "* [Trinsic](https://trinsic.id/)\n",
    "* [eSatus](https://esatus.com/?lang=en)\n",
    "* [LISSI](https://lissi.id/)\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately to date none of the applications are open source, which in my view is leading to a fragmented experience for the individual. It is common to hear the phrase \"Digital wallet's are the browsers of the future\", or something along those lines. To which I often wonder why nobody has made it easy for me to write the equvalent of a webpage. \n",
    "\n",
    "Digital wallet's are an interesting space to keep an eye on. For the interested I recommend this report on [The Current and Future State of Digital Wallet's](https://wiki.hyperledger.org/download/attachments/24775535/The_Current_and_Future_State_of_Digital_Wallets_v1.0_FINAL.pdf?version=1&modificationDate=1574365535000&api=v2) from Darrell O'Donnell. Also available as a [webinar](https://ssimeetup.org/state-digital-identity-crypto-wallets-darrell-odonnell-webinar-22/).\n",
    "\n",
    "The open source offering around mobile agent's and applications is gradually emerging, the most recent being the announcement of the [aries-bifold](https://github.com/Indicio-tech/aries-bifold) application and companion [aries-mobileagent-reactnative](https://github.com/Indicio-tech/aries-mobileagent-react-native) projects. If you would like to help us figure out how we could and should leverage and contribute too these offerings we would love to hear from you. \n",
    "\n",
    "For the moment we have to make do with what is available. So install one of the above applications and make sure you they are pointing to the **Sovrin StagingNet**. Different applications have different ways of changing the network the agent uses, usually in settings, although Connect.Me requires you select the network as part of the installation process.\n"
