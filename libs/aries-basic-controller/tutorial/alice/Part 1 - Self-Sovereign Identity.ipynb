    "\n",
    "By the end of this tutorial we hope you will have a strong grounding in the capabilities of SSI and the ability to use them in your own applications by leveraging the library we have developed.  "

    "## What is SSI?\n",
    "\n",
    "SSI is term used to loosely describe an emerging set of standards and technologies focused on enabling identification, authentication and authorisation between peers without requiring a trusted third party (Identity Provider) to mediate the interaction. As this often compromises privacy (think Facebook Connect).\n",
    "\n",
    "The two key specifications in this space are:\n",
    "* [Decentralised Identifiers (DIDs)](https://w3c.github.io/did-core/) - Self-authenticating identifiers that must be resolvable to a DID Document containing a set of cryptographic keys and communication endpoints.Have a look at the following lecture to get a better idea!:\n",
    "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jcfy9wd5bZI  \n",
    "* [Verifiable Credential Data Model](https://w3c.github.io/vc-data-model/) - A data model for a set of Verifiable Claims.\n",

    "Decentralised identifiers that are stored on a highly available decentralised data storage system, typically a distributed ledger, can be used to\n",

    "## The Hyperledger SSI Stack\n",
    "\n",
    "The hyperledger stack consists of three layers - Indy, Ursa and Aries. This is explored in a lot more detail in this EdX course: [Introduction to Hyperledger Sovereign Identity Blockchain Solutions: Indy, Aries & Ursa](https://www.edx.org/course/identity-in-hyperledger-aries-indy-and-ursa). It's a great place to start for beginners.\n",

    "\n",
    "Hyperledger Indy is responsibly for maintaining the distributed ledger. It consists of two libraries:\n",
    "* [indy-node](https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node) - the code for running a ledger node\n",
    "* [indy-plenum](https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-plenum) - the consensus algorithm used by the ledger.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is possible to run a version of the ledger locally, or to use one of public ledgers currently running.\n",
    "\n",
    "* [IndyScan](https://indyscan.io/home/SOVRIN_MAINNET) - A ledger explorer for Hyperledger Indy ledgers currently covering the Sovrin MainNet, BuilderNet and StagingNet. \n",

    "\n",
    "### Hyperledger Ursa\n",
    "\n",
    "[Hyperledger Ursa](https://github.com/hyperledger/ursa) is the core cryptography library for all Hyperledger projects. It is written in Rust and specific to SSI it includes the anonymous credential cryptography code.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hyperledger Aries\n",
    "\n",
    "Hyperledger Aries deals with the application layer of the SSI stack. It is a set of specifications that define how to develop agents capable of leveraging the cryptography in Ursa and communicating with Indy ledgers enabling them to connect with peers, issue credentials, present proofs and verify proofs.\n",

    "* [Aries Rfcs](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs) - A lot of great content in here. Throughout the tutorial we will refer to rfcs for specific protocols that we are using.\n",

    "These specifications, or some subset of them, can then be implemented in any language you choose. Some examples are:\n",
    "* [Aries Cloud Agent Python](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python) - A python implementation developed by the Government of Brittish Columbia. This is the code base we interact with throughout the tutorial.\n",
