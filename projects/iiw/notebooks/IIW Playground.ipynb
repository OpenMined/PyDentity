    "Welcome to the OpenMined Aries ACA-Py Juypter notebook playground. Using these notebooks you will be able to control your ACA-Py instance to interact with other agents being used at IIW. This should include mobile agents, other agent instances of this playground, trinsic agents and PICO agent applications. Basically any agent that supports the same aries-rfs as ACA-Py.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an experiment and might not work but hopefully it will be fun!\n",
    "\n",
    "It is a playground because we have only created the skeleton to get you started. You can customise your \"SSI Application\" however you see fit by writing custom code right here within the notebooks. We have developed a python wrapper for the ACA-Py swagger api called the [aries-basic-controller](https://pypi.org/project/aries-basic-controller/) and a full tutorial series explaining how to use it to interact with your agent to perform basic agent flows [here](https://github.com/OpenMined/PyDentity/tree/master/tutorials/aries-basic-controller) if you get stuck.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your agent is currently pointing at the Sovrin StagingNet and is using default storage for an indy wallet which is mapped using docker volumes so it should persist across multiple ./manage up's. Additionally the agents endpoint is exposed using ngrok, however this has a timelimit and will be a different url every time the docker is restarted. This *might* mess up the ability to communicate over connections, so the best advice is just to leave it running. Currently the agent is configured with all the --accept flags set that ACA-Py supports, feel free to change this. See the docker-compose.yml and the startup.sh script for more details.\n",

    "We also included an attachment protocol so if you need to send files securely during IIW give it a try.\n",
